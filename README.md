# FAUNMAP_Import
Scripts and Files for exporting FAUNMAP to Neotoma

Files created by Ed Davis, U Oregon and posted to GitHub by Jack Williams, U Wisconsin.

FAUNMAP data originally in Access tables and were exported to XLS by Ed Davis.  R script then parses the XLS file and builds a series of Tilia (.tlx) files in XML format, with one TLX file per geological site.
